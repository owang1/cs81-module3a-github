I've used Git and Github in the past, but it's been a couple years. It was good to review some things like authentication. I also don't really remember configuring git with "git config", so that was something I learned. 
Something that was confusing to me was when I got an error when I tried cloning to the computer, because I put "your-username" instead of my actual username. I looked up the error to figure out my mistake. 
I think developers use Git to have repositories online to show and store their code, and also track changes you make to your code.
I can see it helping with larger projects. You could see who makes what changes to the code, and track changes to the code. Having commit comments would also help you remember what each of the changes do.
